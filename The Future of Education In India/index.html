        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Educational stages</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the central government is expected to bring profound changes to education in India. The policy approved by the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India's new education system.[28] The new policy replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education. The policy is a comprehensive framework for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India. The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2021.[29]
            
            The National Education Policy 2020 has ‘emphasised’ on the use of mother tongue or local language as the medium of instruction till Class 5 while, recommending its continuance till Class 8 and beyond.[30]It also states that no language will be imposed on the students.[31]The language policy in NEP is a broad guideline and advisory in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and schools to decide on the implementation.[32] </p>

            NEP 2020 outlines the vision of India's School education system. The new policy replaces the previous National Policy on Education, 1986. The policy is a comprehensive framework for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India. The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2021. As per NEP2020, the "10 + 2" structure is replaced with "5+3+3+4" model.[34][35][36] 5+3+3+4 refers to 5 foundational years, whether in an anganwadi, pre-school or balvatika. This is followed by 3 years of preparatory learning from classes 3 to 5. This is followed by a middle stage that is of 3 years in length and finally a 4 year secondary stage till class 12 or 18 years of age.[37] This model will be implemented as follows:[38][36]
            
            Instead of exams being held every academic year, school students attend three exams, in classes 2, 5 and 8. Board exams are held for classes 10 and 12. Standards for Board exams is established by an assessment body, PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development). To make them easier, these exams would be conducted twice a year, with students being offered up to two attempts. The exam itself would have two parts, namely the objective and the descriptive.

        <p class="sectionTag  text-big">Covid-19: Reimagining education in post pandemic worlde</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The coronavirus pandemic has seriously upended the education system. Along with the shift from classrooms to computer screens almost all aspects of learning are being tested. Format of instruction, attendance, evaluation, the role of technology, and human interaction are all being re-imagined and there is a growing possibility that some of these changes will last.

            The prolonged closure of schools and colleges has also highlighted some underlying vulnerabilities in the education system and as the various stakeholders strive to address challenges and plug the gap, education, as we know, is going to change forever. Blended learning will be a new norm, which has also been envisaged in our NEP 2020.
            
            Learning by screen or remote learning will continue to play a major role even after schools are able to re-open post the pandemic. Digitisation of education is the future and we have been making significant strides in that direction even before the pandemic struck.
            
            For more than a year now, online classes and remote learning have been the medium through which learning is delivered to students. Teachers, as well as students, have adapted themselves to make the best of this mode of learning. This is not to say that remote learning is the best or the only way forward.
            Some schools in smaller towns and cities are not in a position to hold classes remotely and a large number of students are suffering because of this. Steps must therefore be taken to make remote learning more accessible and everyone can benefit from this mode.
